# This repository provides the Supporting Information (SI) data for the manuscript:

## Chain length dependence of chemically-controlled reactions in polymerization

### The data correspond to the polymer model used in this work, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulation inputs and representative structures.


#### 1. Production MD structures

The repository provides the molecular structures used in the production MD simulations, including:

the initial structure of each production MD run, and

the final structure after the production MD simulation.

These structures are used to illustrate the conformational evolution of the polymer systems during MD simulations.


#### 2. Representative STY structures extracted from MD trajectories

For the polymer model, we provide:

Representative frames extracted from the corresponding production MD trajectory.

These structures are used as example configurations for subsequent sTB calculation.


#### 3. Topology files for MD simulations

The repository also includes the molecular topology (.top) files used in the MD simulations, which define:

molecular connectivity,

bonded interactions, and

force-field related parameters for the polymer systems.

These topology files are required to reproduce the MD simulations reported in this work.


### Description of the polymer model

All structures and topology files in this repository correspond to the polymer model described in the manuscript.
The model is designed to investigate the chain-length dependence of chemically controlled reactions in polymerization.
